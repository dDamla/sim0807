Iraqi Defense Minister Khaled al-Obeidi said on December 11 that more than 17 million pilgrims had come to Karbala for the Arbaeen commemoration.

Millions of pilgrims have come from neighboring Iran, a predominantly Shi'ite country.  Iraq has reportedly waived the $40 visa fee for Iranian nationals.  The festival has been marred by deadly attacks in previous years.
