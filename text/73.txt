ISIL fighters gaining ground in Anbar
Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have mounted two suicide car-bomb attacks aimed at security checkpoints at the main entrance into Haditha city. Haditha, in Iraq's western Anbar province, is currently mostly under the control of the government, with troops and tribesmen holding about 70 percent of the city. ISIL, however, is in control of areas that are in the direction of the border with Syria. Saturday's attacks left at least 12 people dead and 17 more injured, medical sources told Al JAzeera. Nine policemen and three civilians were among the dead, the sources said. Pinpointing military and humanitarian aid from nations in the international struggle against the armed group. Also ISIL fighters overnight on Friday took control of a different area of Anbar province. Al Jazeera's Jane Arraf, reporting from Baghdad, said ISIL took over the village of al-Jabha just after midnight. The village is about 12km west of Ramadi. Our correspondent said ISIL immediately sent out messages from loudspeakers in the mosques telling residents that if they did not fight back, they would be safe. "ISIL made clear that they are fighting to regain the corridor between tribes that have turned against ISIL and the military command operation centre in Ramadi," Al Jazeera's Arraf said. "There was fierce fighting across Anbar. ISIL has taken over more than a dozen villages in the past few days. Residents there say its clear ISIL is making gains there, prompting desperate calls, including from the provisional council head, for foreign troops to come and help them."
