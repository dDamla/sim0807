Suicide Bombers Strike In Two Iraqi Cities
Two separate suicide bombing attacks in Iraq on November 11 have left at least 15 people dead. One suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden vehicle into a crowd in the city of Baiji, some 250 kilometers north of Baghdad, killing at least eight people, including six soldiers. Government forces and pro-government militias have been battling to recapture the city and the nearby oil refinery. Militants from the so-called Islamic State captured the city five months ago but the Iraqi military and militiamen have reached the center of Baiji and were reportedly pushing toward the refinery. A second suicide bomber drove his vehicle into a military outpost in the northern Baghdad district of Tarmiyah, killing seven soldiers and wounding 13 others. Among those reported killed in the Tarmiyah attack was the outpost's commander.
