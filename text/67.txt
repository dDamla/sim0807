Three people were killed and 13 others were injured in two Baghdad explosions Thursday, a security source told The Anadolu Agency. “A bomb exploded in the afternoon near a restaurant in Al-Shaab district in Northern Baghdad, killing one person and wounding five others,” the source said. "Another bomb exploded near a market in Al-Madaen in Southern Baghdad, leaving two people dead and eight others wounded." No group has declared responsibility for the attacks so far. A number of Iraqi provinces have witnessed explosions targeting security forces and civilians in recent months. Meanwhile, a fierce armed conflict continues between ISIL and Iraqi security forces.  The security situation in the country has deteriorated since June, when ISIL stormed the northern province of Mosul and declared what it calls a caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
